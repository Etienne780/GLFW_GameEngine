# GLFW_Test

This project is a personal learning exercise aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of **C++**, **GLFW**, and the architecture of a basic game engine. It serves as a foundation for experimenting with rendering, input handling, and application structure.

## Features

- Window creation using GLFW  
- Basic input system (keyboard and mouse)  
- Time management (delta time, total time)  
- Math (VectorN, and Matrix class)
- GameObject Component system

## Goals

- Learn how to build a minimal game engine framework  
- Understand how to separate engine logic from game logic  
- Practice modern C++ design (templates, smart pointers, virtual functions)

## Build Requirements

- Tested with **C++20**
- **GLFW**
- **GLAD**
- **Visual Studio 2022** (must learn **CMake**)

## External Dependencies

- **GLFW**
- **GLAD**
- **ImGUI**
- **Tinyfiledialogs**
