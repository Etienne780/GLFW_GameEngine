# GLFW_Test

This project is a personal learning exercise aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of **C++**, **GLFW**, and the architecture of a basic game engine. It serves as a foundation for experimenting with rendering, input handling, and application structure.

## Features

- Window creation using GLFW  
- Basic input system (keyboard and mouse)  
- Time management (delta time, total time)  
- Math utilities (vectors, interpolation, etc.)  
- Modular structure with custom engine and application classes

## Goals

- Learn how to build a minimal game engine framework  
- Understand how to separate engine logic from game logic  
- Practice modern C++ design (templates, smart pointers, virtual functions)

## Build Requirements

- **C++17 or higher** (tested with C++20)
- **GLFW** (linked manually or via package manager)  
- **CMake** or **Visual Studio 2019+**
